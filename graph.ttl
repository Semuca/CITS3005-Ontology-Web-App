If you go too far, back off a little bit until you get it right.''' Anything less then a 80% read rate should be considered a failure. This is because the laser probably does not have much life left in it and replacement is a better option. If you are dealing with one of these systems, its's best to find a good used laser that works, or a NOS one. '''Before starting, take a picture of the laser and mark the original position before adjusting the laser.''' Adjust the laser trimpot in small amounts at a time. Using a '''Philips PH1''' screwdriver, turn the trimpot a few times. Do this until you can confirm the laser reads games again, and test the average for the amount of games successfully read." ;

    props:actions "Reverse disassembly of the system. Once the system is reassembled, test a few games and see what the system does. If you adjusted it too much and the laser does not try, dial it back a little bit until it no longer happens. The ideal number is 80-90% of games read successfully. To test the read percentage, get a few known good games and put them in the system. I recommend a minimum of 5 test games or more. '''Note: While performing a read test, do not do further adjustments until you have the results in hand and you are not satisfied with what you got.''' If you can get the game to load, play each game on the system for a little bit and watch for any playback problems. If an issue comes up, take note of it. If this happens, make a note and make sure it isn't something with that game in your system, as this is sometimes the case with some model systems. '''Improving the read percentage:''' If you are not happy with the results, adjust the laser assembly further. Once this is done, try again. If you hit the point where the motor doesn't try and spin the game at the right speed, go up or dial it back a little bit more. Once you find the sweet spot, keep it there and do not adjust further. If you see the '''Insert PlayStation CD-ROM''' screen, you are going too slow for the system to read the game. If you see this happen, you will need to increase the trimpot further. '''Having a reference system:''' If you have a second system on hand, use this to develop an average for how well your repaired system holds up against a working system that does not have a laser problem. You can also use this to gauge the success of the repair on your bad system a well." ;

Be sure to apply a generous amount of solder to the connections to make sure they connect well and are reasonably durable.

If you don't know what tinning is, check this link for details: [http://www.mediacollege.com/misc/solder/tinning.html] It is also a good idea to label each cable if you need help remembering witch cable connects to the positive end of the battery as well as which cable is the negative end.

    props:actions "Now looking at the PCB on it's own, Take note of the 4 Solder Terminals marked on the second image of this step. The two terminals circled in Red are the Battery terminals. These terminals compose of the positive and negative pins attached to the battery on the other side of the PCB. The positive terminal is the one higher on the board in this image, while the negative terminal is the one below the first. The two terminals circled in Green are the Resistor terminals. The two terminals are the ends of two resistors seen on the other side of the PCB. Why are these important? Well, these terminals are what we will be connecting our Parity Battery to. Why connect the Parity Battery to resistors you ask? Well there's logic behind this. Take note of the PCB around the two battery terminals on the first image of this step. If you're unaware of how circuit boards work, the lighter green areas of a PCB (visible in the image) indicate a copper lining under the solder mask. This copper lining is the link between certain terminals on the PCB. In this case, you'll notice that there's copper lining on the board that links the positive batter terminal with the resistor terminal next to it. The negative terminal in the same respect. This is marked in the second image written in blue. To confirm this, you can use your Multimeter to check the voltage of the battery on its two terminals (Red). if you check the two resistor terminals (Green) in the same way, you'll notice that it displays the same voltage as the battery terminals. By attaching the Parity Battery to these resistor terminals, electricity will continue to run through the PCB and hold the sensitive data stored on the cartridges SRAM. Meaning that while you replace the Main battery on the PCB, the cartridges saves will not be deleted the moment that the board loses power. KEEP IN MIND, that the positive end of the parity battery must connect on the positive circuit of the PCB. Parity is ONLY achieved if the positive and negative ends of the battery are connected to their respective circuits. If you connect the battery the other way around, you'll end up connecting your batteries in Series, which increases Voltage." ;

    props:actions "One disadvantage of retro console controllers is the cable. Tethered at a specific distance from the console, most controller cables wind up on the floor which makes them prone to being stepped on. Floors, from a medical perspective, are assumed to always be dirty even immediately after being cleaned. There's a reason for this... Imagine all the things you step in, while wearing your shoes, throughout an average day. Need I remind you of the dreaded public restroom? The bottoms of your shoes are among some of the dirtiest things around. Now imagine you or your kids stepping on your cords on a regular basis. Even if it looks clean a bleach wipe will quickly prove you wrong. This is the easiest part of the refurbishing process. Simply put on some gloves, grab a bleach wipe and start rubbing down your controller cable. I recommend going both directions down the cord. By that I mean start at the base of the controller cord, down to the console port and then reverse the direction. I've found that simply going from top to bottom isn't sufficient enough for some of the more stubborn dirt that's near the console port. Reversing the direction seems to be the easy fix for removing that dirt at the end of the cable. Repeat this process, using as many wipes as necessary, to remove this dirt/bacteria. You'll feel an instant difference when it's dry and it'll almost feel like new. When you're satisfied with the cleanliness of the cord take your electronics cleaner and spray inside the console port to clean the inside and ensure a clean and solid connection when you plug in your controller. This step is now complete. It's time to go sanitize everything else. I wear gloves through most of this process in order to prevent touching the chemicals and to prevent my own skin oils from affecting the end result of the plastic finish. Wearing gloves is purely optional but it is recommended. Gloves are not necessary during the cleaning process when only using soap but if you're doing several controllers your hands won't dry out from all the washing and your skin will thank you. This is one of the cleaner controller cords I've cleaned. There's many variables that will affect how dirty your cord is so results will vary here. Used controllers are usually much dirtier than this one." ;

If preserving the sticker is important to you then take care and be gentle when washing the sticker on the back cover. Use gentle pressure with your fingers in this area. Sometimes there are \"trouble spots\" or dirt patches on the cover and can remain after you wash it. Take note of these spots and pay extra attention to them when washing. If they remain, even after a vigorous cleaning use a Qtip and rubbing alcohol to try and remove the spot. If a Qtip doesn't work simply use it to wet the trouble spot and use a plastic prying tool to scrape it off. Sometimes they require significant force to remove and the plastic tool doesn't scratch the cover. Nail polish remover can be used here but I don't recommend it." ;

Open the bottle of Salon Care 40 Volume Creme and pour some out onto the shell. Do your best to cover the entire surface evenly. This is easier said than done due to the shells odd shape. Just do the best you can. Smooth out the extra creme that poured off your controller, onto the Saran Wrap, in a big enough surface to cover the controller. Quickly flip the shell over and cover the entire shell with the Saran Wrap. Try not to leave open airways as you don't want the solution to dry. If you need an extra piece of Saran Wrap to completely cover the shell now is the time. When shell is completely wrapped flip it back over and place it into the container that will be holding the shell. I recommend an aluminum pan or glass dish of some kind as they will help reflect the UV light projected from your black light bulb. If you are cleaning a white controller the process is the same for the front shell." ;

    props:actions "This is my setup. It's only an example. Your black light room/setup doesn't need to be identical to mine in order for this to work. Just get your items to be restained as close to the UV light as possible. Here I've used a storage closet that seldom gets used as my black light room. I had to make some adjustments and shift some stuff around but my pan sits about a foot under the light. I can't explain the science behind why this works but there's a chemical reaction when the Salon Care 40 Creme sits under UV light. The end result is quite astounding. Especially if your restoring a console or controller that is badly yellowed, it can restore its original color. DO NOT attempt this with dark plastics as it can warp the original color. The reason for doing this is simple and is done for one of two reasons. Either you have a console/controller that's yellowed or you simply want to restore the original shine to the plastic. Even if your controller isn't discolored it still adds a \"new\" look and feel to it. I let mine sit for 24hrs before removing it from the room. Coincidentally, if the back sticker is important to you, this will also help discolor that back sticker if it's looking a little nasty from years of use/storage. If time is a factor and you want to finish this ASAP these first 5 steps needs to be done in order. The staining process is simple but timely. Make the most of your time by cleaning everything else after you begin your \"baking period\". Otherwise, your wasting time. This step is the ONLY reason that this is labeled to take 1-2 days. You can leave your shell under the UV black light as long/little as you want. Just know that the longer it's under the light the better the results." ;

Grab your remaining parts to be cleaned and clean them using hot/warm water and antibacterial soap. Remember, the idea with all this is to remove the previous user(s) bacteria. A toothbrush or nail brush works really well at cleaning the hard to reach places that water pressure alone won't clean. Use them to clean the buttons if there's dirt in the A/X/B/Y indention and the circular indention on the front shell. If you're cleaning a white shell this should have been in Step 3. When cleaning the rubber pad that goes with your D-Pad be careful not to loose the little plastic piece in the center as it does separate from the rubber pad. Without it your D-Pad won't function properly if at all. When you've finished cleaning your remaining pieces set the rubber pads and VMU slot holder out of the way to air dry. You are done with these pieces until the reassembly process. I HIGHLY recommend using a strainer of some sort that fits your sinks drain for this step. If you loose these pieces down the drain you'll have two choices: 1) Go fishing for them in the pipes or 2) Purchase replacement buttons" ;

After the final coat is applied I use the dish soap to do a final clean of the shell and to remove any remaining polish. I use the dish soap because it's a little thicker, and lathers more which helps get the remaining polish off. This process is tedious and slightly time consuming. I average 1-1.5hrs work time when polishing, buffing, rinsing and repeating 3 times and the final clean with dish soap. The end results are worth it but you can polish your stuff as much as you feel is necessary." ;

Clean it with a Qtip and rubbing alcohol and use a toothbrush or nail brush to clean the underside of the stick if you so desire. Don't forget to clean the triggers as a lot of dirt can build up on them. Spray some of your electronics cleaner into the VMU slots and then spray an airgun into the slots.

If this happens simply reattach the broken piece with a small amount of super glue/crazy glue. Don't totally rush the reassembly process. Make sure EVERYTHING is dry before proceeding. Place a small fan in front of all your wet/damp pieces for faster dry times or even better use an airgun and you can usually remove most of the moisture.

    props:actions "Now, we will connect the Parity Battery to the PCB as shown in the image of this step. Many things could go wrong here, so ensure that you have properly followed Step 2 and you are confident in handling a soldering iron for precision jobs. Begin by heating up the two ends of the parity batteries cables to the point that the tinning on them starts to melt again. CAUTION: Be careful that you do not cause to much heat as it may adversely affect the battery itself. Now start heating up the resistors terminals (circled in green on step 5) to the point that the solder on them starts to melt. CAUTION: Again, be careful how hot the terminals get. You don't want to damage the resistors OR the board itself. Also, too much heat may add extra resistance on the power coming from the battery, losing the SRAM data. For the novices: The reason you need to heat up both ends of what you're soldering is because the solder itself needs to \"Flow\" onto both surfaces like liquid and that's only possible when they're hot. Looking at the solder terminals as they are now (the images in step 5), you can see how well those solders look. That's what we need to achieve. This is your last warning: '''DO NOT MIX UP THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ENDS OF THE PARITY BATTERY WHEN CONNECTING TO THE BOARD!''' You want the batteries in Parity, not Series. Now, carefully solder the end of the parity batteries positive cable to the Higher resistor terminal. Ensure that the solder properly flows onto both the resistors pin AND the end of the parity batteries cable almost like liquid. Again, be careful about how much heat is applied. You need to melt the solder, but you must not damage anything. Follow the same method for soldering the end of the parity batteries negative cable to the LOWER resistor terminal. Once you feel the parity battery is properly attached to the terminals, let the solder cool for a minute or two." ;

    props:actions "Now to test that you've made a good connection with the solder. Set your Multimeter to 20 Ohms and test the connection between the main battery terminals and the parity battery. For visual reference, do as shown in the two images on this step. The Ohm reading you get by testing the connections should show a solid number somewhere around 1 Ohm. This indicates that you've made a good solder connection. You'll see that the reading I got when testing my negative connection (second image) shows 1.2 Ohms, compared to the much better reading from the positive connection (first image) which shows 0.9. Although it's not perfect, it's all good as long as the number does not variate to far from 1 Ohm. If it does, the connection is loose. Another test to do is to check the voltage now shown when testing the main battery. You should now see the voltage read somewhere higher than 3v rather than when the old battery would show something more along the lines of near 3 or 2.98. Either way, seeing a slightly higher voltage than before means you've successfully created a Parity system. I don't know what would happen if you accidentally put your batteries in Serial, but I'm pretty sure your cartridge would explode (or something like that) if it suddenly had 6 volts running through it.

    props:actions "'''IT IS RECOMMENDED TO HAVE ANOTHER PERSON WITH YOU TO HELP WITH THIS STEP''' Now that the parity battery is attached, it's time to remove the old battery that we'll be replacing. Grab a flat head screwdriver in place it underneath the battery on the other side of the PCB. Now start carefully heating up the solder on one of the main batteries terminals. While melting the solder, use the screwdriver to carefully push the battery out from the board using the screwdriver as a lever. Eventually, the battery should come loose and the pin should fall from the PCB easily, given you're providing enough pushing force with the screwdriver. Follow the same method for removing the other pin from the PCB. This time however, you can pull the battery out while melting the solder rather than using the screwdriver to lever the battery out. Just to be sure, use your Multimeter to test the main battery terminals after you've removed the old battery and check that there's still electricity running through the circuit. If you get a stable voltage reading from the main battery terminals (circled Red in step 5) after you've removed the old battery, then your save game is still safe." ;

Again, start carefully heating up the solder on and inside the main battery terminals. While the solder's hot and melted, use you Soldering Pump to extract the solder off of the terminal and out of the inside of the terminal. It might also be a good idea to have someone else use the soldering pump for you while you use the soldering iron. If there's still some solder left inside the terminal, you may have to use something thin to file it out. Keep in mind that this is a last resort as there's a risk of tiny bits of solder going everywhere after filing. After cleaning the terminals, the result should be something like the second image of this step. Although it's a bit blurry, you can clearly see that the terminals are very clean and open." ;

However, you're free to use a standard CR2032 battery with pins already attached to it. A battery holder will make future replacements easier. Place the new battery in the same position that the old battery was in on the PCB. '''NOTE for Battery Holder users:''' You may need to modify the holder slightly. Take note of the second image in this step. One of my cartridges resistors was placed very close to the battery and resulted in it blocking the placement of the holder. If you're in a similar situation, you will need to file off the corner of your holder as shown. With the battery in place, begin to '''carefully''' heat up the terminal and the batteries pins. I use the word \"carefully\" in the literal sense. Heating up a battery is universally NOT  a good idea, but all you need is just enough heat that the replacement solder will flow on to the pin properly. Once the terminals and pins are hot enough, begin applying a generous amount amount of new solder to the space between the pins and the terminals. Once you're done, you should have something that looks like the third image in this step. Let the solder cool off after you're finished. Test the terminals with your Multimeter to make sure everything is still operating normally." ;

Make sure you're heating up the resistor pin, the terminal, and the parity batteries cable end as you're doing so. While heating up the solder, gently pull on the cable until it comes loose. If you happen to pull off too much solder when detaching the parity batteries cable, quickly start applying more solder to the resistors terminal to ensure the connection remains solid. You don't want to go through all this work for nothing. Do the same thing for the next resistor terminal. After you've taken off the parity battery, get your Multimeter and test both the main battery terminals and the resistor terminals to make sure that your new battery is supplying a solid 3 volts of power to the cartridge. Also check for an Ohm reading between the resistor terminals and the main battery terminals on their respective copper lining circuits. You should again get a reading of around 1 Ohm in your tests. If everything checks out, then that's it! You're done! You've successfully replaced a Nintendo 64 cartridge battery and, if everything went smoothly during the replacement, without losing power to the SRAM chip and deleting your Save Data!" ;

This is because as I was replacing the screw before it, I broke my bit.  I was using a 1/16\" flathead bit (I don't have a T6 Torx) and used just a little too much torque and it snapped.  I found another 1/16\" bit to finish, but didn't get a pic. If you have Torx bits/drivers, use them.  They will work much better than the flatheads." ;

Also interesting to note: this is a Seagate drive, while the 250GB drive upgrade I mention in the description requires a WD drive.
